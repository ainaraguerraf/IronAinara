When people meet me for the first time they take me for a serious and introverted person but I am actually the most clownish, clumsy, and joking person in my group of friends. I'm always goofing around and at work I always try to make a joke or tell an anecdote to brighten people's day when our tasks are overflowing. Don't worry, be happy!
